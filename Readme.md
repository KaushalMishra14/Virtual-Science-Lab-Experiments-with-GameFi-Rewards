# Virtual Science Lab Experiments with GameFi Rewards

## Project Description

The **Virtual Science Lab** project is a decentralized platform that allows users to conduct virtual science experiments and earn GameFi rewards in the form of tokens. Users must pay a platform fee to register, and upon successfully completing experiments, they receive token rewards as incentives.

The project combines education and blockchain technology to promote interactive learning and reward engagement through gamification.
